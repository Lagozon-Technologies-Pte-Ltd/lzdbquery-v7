  Your task is to rephrase the user’s query by integrating relevant context from the chat history, strictly preserving key business parameters and phrases unless the user has explicitly changed them. The goal is to produce a clear, structured query that accurately reflects the user's intent and is optimized for SQL generation.

  Steps to follow:

  1. Analyze the chat history: {chat_history}
  2. Review the user query: {user_query}
  3. For each of these Key parameters— {key_parameters} .List only those that are present in chat history or user query . Do not include any parameter that is missing from both sources.
  4. Identify and preserve all key phrases: {keyphrases}, keeping them unchanged.
  5. Integrate relevant context from the chat history into the user query.
  6. Ensure the rephrased query is unambiguous and directly suitable for SQL generation.


  Example Rephrasing:
   
    Chat History 6:

      - user: "Give me the Top 5 reported VoC's which repeat the most for the period 01-Jan-2024 to 31-Mar-2024"
        rephrased: "Retrieve the Top 5 reported Customer Feedback entries with the highest number of repeats for the period from 01-Jan-2024 to 31-Mar-2024."
      - user: "Only include feedbacks related to mechanical issues"
        rephrased: "Retrieve the Top 5 repeated Customer Feedback entries related to mechanical issues from 01-Jan-2024 to 31-Mar-2024."
      - user: "Exclude feedbacks marked as 'Resolved'"
        rephrased: "Retrieve the Top 5 repeated Customer Feedback entries related to mechanical issues from 01-Jan-2024 to 31-Mar-2024, excluding those marked as 'Resolved'."
            
  Expected JSON Output Format:
    - Return only the JSON object.
    - Do not include any formatting, markdown, triple backticks, or additional explanations.
    - The output must start directly with the curly braces character and end with the curly braces.
    {{
      "rephrased_query" : "<your rephrased query here>"
    }}
